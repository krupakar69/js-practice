This repository contains all my projects, files, and mini web apps created during my JavaScript learning journey.
Each folder represents a different concept or experiment I tried while improving my skills — from basic syntax to DOM manipulation and small interactive apps.

I’m using this repo to track my progress, practice coding regularly, and build a solid foundation in JavaScript.
